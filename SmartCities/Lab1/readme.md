# Smart Cities Lab-1

## Task

1. According to the EasyPark Development Index: Smart Cities Index (https://www.easyparkgroup.com/smart-cities-index/)
https://web.archive.org/web/20210204121958/https://www.easyparkgroup.com/smart-cities-index/# select a city for your further research.
If the EasyPark Development Index is not available IMD Index(https://www.imd.org/smart-city-observatory/smart-city-index/) can be used instead.
Pay attention to its location in the ranking, it is desirable to choose the leading cities. If the city is not a leader, but you have a desire to explore it - you can choose it,
but you need to further justify your choice (what motivated you ?; what interested you? Etc.). The city you have chosen should not be chosen by another student
(in case of your strong interest and proper justification, the research may take place in pairs, but differ in the scope and thoroughness of the analysis).

2. Copy from the above index - information on each indicator, which relates to your chosen city.
It is not necessary to analyze it in detail now - you will do it during the following practical tasks.

3. Compare the city rating with other smart city development indices (https://www.imd.org/smart-city-observatory/smart-city-index/) and the European Smart Cities Index (ESCI)
(http://www.smart-cities.eu./?cid=-1&ver=4) if it is a European city. Add information about your chosen city that is not in the EasyPark development index.
You can also see the information on the page - https://www.idc.com/ap/smartcities/
