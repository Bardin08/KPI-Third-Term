# Smart Cities Lab-2

## Task
1. Identify the main components and areas of development of your chosen smart city (by analogy with the Smart Cities Development Plan of Australia - https://www.infrastructure.gov.au/cities/smart-cities/plan/index.aspx).

2. Explain why these areas are relevant for the selected city, what is the reason for this. Provide a link to the appropriate web page of the city where this need is met.

3. Compare the experience of Australia with the experience of your chosen city - note what they have in common and how they differ.

4. How cooperation between all stakeholders (stakeholders) for the development of a smart city is envisaged.

5. Identify problems that you think may be an obstacle (or are) to the effectiveness of this cooperation.
